# Dev Diary

### Motivation
I started this project because I read this article from Medium: https://levelup.gitconnected.com/every-software-engineer-should-start-writing-work-log-template-f91197acd630. I very much agree that every software engineer should keep a work diary. Personally, sometimes I find myself not remembering what I was doing or what features I should work on next when I come back to the project the next day. Even more so when I've taken some time away from coding. 

Another reason why I want to make this app is because people often forget what they have accomplished at work. During my unemployment days, I was trying to polish my resume. I had to really brainstorm my accomplishments and my impact at my previous work place. I realized from now on, I should probably have a document where I can record and keep track of my accomplishments and impact at work. This is crucial for performance evaluation at the company and polishing your resume. 

So I thought, instead of writing down notes and keep a separate document for all of my accomplishments and impact at work, why don't I just make this into an app?
